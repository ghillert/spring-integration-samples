Spring Integration Samples
==========================

# Introduction

Welcome to the Spring Integration Samples. To simplify your experience, Spring Integration Samples were split into 4 distinct categories. Inside of each category you'll find a 'README.md' which will contain a more detailed description of that category's specifics. Each sample also comes with its own 'readme.txt' file explaining details.

*Happy Integration!*

# Categories

Below is a short description of each category.

## Basic

This is a good place to get started. The samples here are technically motivated and demonstrate the bare minimum with regard to configuration and code to help you to get introduced to the basic concepts, API and configuration of Spring Integration. For example if you are looking for an answer on how to wire service-activator  to a channel or how to apply Gateway to your message exchange or how to get started with using MAIL or XML the module,  this would be the right place to find a relevant sample. The bottom line is that this is a good starting point.

## Intermediate

This category targets developers who are already familiar with the Spring Integration framework (past getting started), but need some more guidance while resolving more advanced technical problems that you have to deal with when switching to a Messaging architecture. For example, if you are looking for an answer on how to handle errors in various scenarios, or how to properly configure an Aggregator for the situations where some messages might not ever arrive  for aggregation, or any other issue that goes beyond a basic understanding and configuration of a particular component to address "what else you can do?" types of problems, this would be the right place to find relevant samples.

## Advanced

This category targets advanced developers who are quite familiar with the Spring Integration framework but looking to address a specific custom need by extending from the Spring Integration public API. For example, if you are looking for samples showing you how to implement a custom Channel or Consumer (event-based or polling-based), or you are trying to figure out what is the most appropriate way to implement a custom BeanParser on top of the Spring Integration BeanParser hierarchy when implementing a custom namespace, this would be the right place to look. Here you can also find samples that will help you with adapter development. Spring Integration comes with an extensive library of adapters that allow you to connect remote systems with the Spring Integration messaging framework. However you might have a need to integrate with a system for which the core framework does not provide an adapter, so you have to implement your own. This category would include samples showing you how to implement various adapters.

## Applications

This category targets developers and architects who have a good understanding of Message-driven architecture and Enterprise Integration Patterns, and an above average understanding of Spring and Spring integration and who are looking for samples that address a particular business problem. In other words, the emphasis of samples in this category is 'business use cases' and how they can be solved via a Messaging architecture and Spring Integration in particular. For example, if you are interested to see how a Loan Broker process or Travel Agent process could be implemented and automated via Spring Integration, this would be the right place to find these types of samples.
