									$$ ADVANCED Samples $$

This category targets advanced developers who are well familiar with Spring Integration framework but looking to 
extend it to address a specific custom need by extending from Spring Integration public API. 
For example; if you are looking for samples showing you how to implement a custom Channel or 
Consumer (event-based or polling-based), or you trying to figure out what is the most appropriate way to implement 
custom BeanParser on top of Spring Integration�BeanParser�hierarchy when implementing custom name space, 
this would be the right place to look.
Here you can also find samples that will help you with adapter development. Spring Integration comes with an extensive 
library of adapters that allow you to connect remote systems with Spring Integration messaging framework. 
However you might have a need to integrate with system for which the core framework does not provide an adapter. 
So you have to implement your own. This category would include samples showing you how to implement various adapters.
